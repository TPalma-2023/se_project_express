# WTWR Project Description

The backend of WTWR utilizes the MERN stack, a robust combination of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. This stack lays the foundation for a RESTful API catering to the needs of the WTWR frontend application. MongoDB serves as the database, while Express.js takes the lead in handling server-side operations. Within the repository, preliminary error handling has been implemented and tested using Postman. The ultimate objective is to develop a server equipped with a comprehensive API and robust user authorization mechanisms.

# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.
